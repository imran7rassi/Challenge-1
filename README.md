# <Challenge-1>

## Description

When I view the website I found a few bugs users reported. I got a ticket to go and find the issues within the HTML and CSS files to make the website more useful for users. I solved the issues and make the HTML more semantic so when others that look at the code will find it more clearly and useful. At last of this homework I found that having semantics within the fles make it easier to find the issues in code and fix it easily and clearly.

## Installation

At first when I receieved the starter code I used the git pull command from git bush to download the files that I needed to my computer. I was working on vs code to fix the issues and I frequently used git commits and pushes to github to get my repository up to date and make sure that mu website is up to date.
