# <Challenge-1>

## Description

When I view the website I found a few bugs users reported. I got a ticket to go and find the issues within the HTML and CSS files to make the website more useful for users. I solved the issues and make the HTML more semantic so when others that look at the code will find it more clearly and useful. At last of this homework I found that having semantics within the fles make it easier to find the issues in code and fix it easily and clearly.

## Installation

At first when I receieved the starter code I used the git pull command from git bush to download the files that I needed to my computer. I was working on vs code to fix the issues and I frequently used git commits and pushes to github to get my repository up to date and make sure that mu website is up to date. Below are the steps of installation:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.
2. When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.
